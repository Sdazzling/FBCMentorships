First day of learning
  My first day of learning was fun. I learnt some basics shell commands like:
  mkdir --making or creating of directory
  cd    --changing of directory
  rmdir --remove directory
  ls    --listing of file
  rm    --remove recursively
  rm -rf  --remove forcefully
  cd ../..  --go back to previous folders
then I was given some interesting exercises which I did successfully. I also learnt about the Github community and signed up for it. I was taught how to write and submit repository on Git.
